# Data files (cached)

This folder is **what the GitHub Pages site reads**.

- `predictions.json` / `groundhogs.json`
  - generated by: `npm run update:predictions`
  - source: https://groundhog-day.com/api (see the API page)
- `outcomes.csv`
  - either fill manually, or try: `npm run update:outcomes:us`
  - **You control the definition** of “correct”. Be explicit on the site.
  - Optional column: `winter_bucket` (winter-intensity tag)
    - values: `EARLY_WINTER` or `NORMAL_WINTER` **only when** `outcome=LONG_WINTER` (blank otherwise)
    - does **not** change scoring (groundhog forecasts are still binary); it just tags how extreme a winter was.
    - the NOAA helper uses a configurable threshold via env var `WINTER_THRESHOLD_F` (default `1.0`).

Sample files are included as `*.sample.*` so the site works immediately.
